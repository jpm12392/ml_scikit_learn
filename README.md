This is a simple example using the popular scikit-learn library for creating a basic linear regression model
Now, let's create a simple Python script to demonstrate creating a linear regression model:<br/><br/>
This script generates some random data, splits it into training and testing sets, creates a linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model using mean squared error. Finally, it visualizes the data and the regression line.<br/><br/>
