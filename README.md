# ml_scikit_learn
This is a simple example using the popular scikit-learn library for creating a basic linear regression model
Now, let's create a simple Python script to demonstrate creating a linear regression model:<br/><br/>
This script generates some random data, splits it into training and testing sets, creates a linear regression model, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model using mean squared error. Finally, it visualizes the data and the regression line.<br/><br/>

<!-- Image Processing -->
Creating an image processing model in Python typically involves using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and possibly others depending on your specific requirements. Here's a simple example using OpenCV to perform basic image processing operations like reading an image, converting it to grayscale, and applying a Gaussian blur.
